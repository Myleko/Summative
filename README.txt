MikoÅ‚aj Wyszogrodzki summative art website 

ESLint - there is not separate ESLint file, however its working on my JS code. After installing ESLin, instead of separate file if got number of different files and repositories which I all included in final submission

Json --> I have created Json data file however I don't understand how to connect it to Bar chart in my JS file 

JSdocs --> I installed JSdocs successfully on my laptop adn after running the code I again got number of different repositories and no HTML file with my comments from my JS file. When I try to run "jsdoc art.js" command it receive "Command not found: jsdoc" information. JSdoc is installed globally on my laptop as well as on my desktop and this assignment repository. Unfortunately "jsdoc art.js" command still doesn't work.

--> As suggested by Ms Suncica, I tried to used different machine to install JSdoc and create HTML file with comments for my JS file, however with the same result. No file was created after I run JSdoc command on different machine.
